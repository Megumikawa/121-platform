## Documentation
The documentation of the 121 platform can be found on the Wiki of this repository on GitHub.


## Getting Started
To set up a local development-environment:

### On Windows

#### Install dependencies
- Install Node.js (<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>)  
  To prevent conflicts between projects or components using other versions of Node.js it is recommended to use a 'Node version manager'.  
  Make sure to install the version specified in the [`.node-version`](.node-version)-file
- Install Git (<https://git-scm.com/download/win>)
- Install Docker (<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>)

### On Linux

#### Install dependencies
- Install Node.js  
  To install the required version of Node.js and to prevent conflicts between projects or components using other versions of Node.js, use [NVM - Node Version Manager](http://nvm.sh/).  
  After installing NVM run:

      nvm install && nvm install-latest-npm

- Install Git

      sudo apt install git-all

- Install Docker  
  On linux distributions we need to install `docker engine` and `docker-compose` respectively. On other platforms they are available through Docker Desktop. Read more at: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>

  `Docker compose` relies on `docker engine`, so in order to get started we must install `docker-engine` first. (Read more at: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>). There are various ways of installing `docker engine` (repository, packages or automated scripts). The official recommended way doing that is through setting up a repository.

  - First off, uninstall any old version of docker-engine.

        sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

  - Choose an installation method from the provided list at <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods> and install `docker-engine`
  - Test your docker installation

        sudo docker run hello-world

  - Now install docker-compose  
    Can be done by following the steps:

        sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

    Reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

  - Test the docker compose installation

        docker-compose --version

  - Additionally, we need to install `docker-machine` as well.

        base=https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.0 && curl -L $base/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/tmp/docker-machine && sudo mv /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine &&   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

       Reference: https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/

  - You are set!

### On macOS

#### Install dependencies
- Install Node.js  
  To install the required version of Node.js and to prevent conflicts between projects or components using other versions of Node.js, use [NVM - Node Version Manager](http://nvm.sh/).  
  After installing NVM run:

      nvm install && nvm install-latest-npm

- Install Git  
  <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git> > Installing on macOS (section)
- Install Docker (<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/>)  
  Install docker-machine, see: <https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/>

        base=https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.0 && curl -L $base/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/usr/local/bin/docker-machine && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

  Once the dependencies are resolved depending on your OS, as above we can set-up the repositories and other environment variables

## Setup Repository
Download/Clone the Git repository.

    git clone https://github.com/global-121/121-platform.git


## Setup Interfaces
Install all dependencies for all interfaces. From the root of this repository, run:

    npm run install:interfaces

Or to install 1 specific interface's dependencies, run: (where `<interface-name>` is one of `pa`, `aw`, `ho`, `referral`)

    npm run install:<interface-name>

## Setup Services
Install dependencies for the interfaces, from the individual interface directories (`services/*`) run:

    npm install


Follow the "[Getting started / installation](services/README.md#getting-started--installation)"-section in the [services/README](services/README.md)-file.

After that, you can start in development mode by running from the root of this repository:
- `npm run start:services`

## Start Interfaces
To start all interfaces at once, execute `npm run start:interfaces` from the root of this repository.

To start an individual interface in development mode:
- Run `npm run start:<interface-name>`, where `<interface-name>` is one of `pa`, `aw`, `ho`, `referral`.
- Or explore the specific options(to run the native Android version, for example) as defined in each interface's own `package.json` or `README.md`.


## Testing
- Scenarios of end-to-end/integration-tests for the whole platform are described in [`/features`](features/#readme).
- Each component has its own individual tests:
  - Unit-tests and UI-tests for all interfaces; Run with `npm test` in each `interfaces/*`-folder.
  - Unit-tests and integration-tests for all services; Run with `npm test` in each `services/*`-folder.

## Common problems with Local Environment set-up
If the swagger UI is not accessible after installing docker and setting up services, we can take following steps to debug:
1. `docker-compose ps` to list running containers and their statuses
2. `docker-compose logs -f <container-name>` to check their statuses

- If the errors are related to not being able to access/connect to 'database' then resetting the database by using `dropSchema: true` in `ormconfig.ts`.

- In order to access an individual docker container, execute command `docker-compose exec -it <container-name> sh` and verify installation of npm modules.

- If there are issues with Docker commands, it could be due to permissions. Prefix your commands with `sudo docker....`


## Unit Tests
### Why?
There are a few reasons why we write unit tests cases:
- Unit tests are written to ensure the integrity the functional level aspect of the code written. It helps us identify mistakes, unnecessary code and also when there is room for improvement to make the code more intuitive and efficient.
- We also write unit test cases to clearly state what the method is supposed to do, so it is smoother for new joiners to be onboarded
- It helps us achieve recommended devOps protocols for maintaining code base while working within teams.

### Maintenance with future changes
How are Unit Tests affected when we make changes within the code in future?
- We should aim to write and update unit tests along side the current development, so that our tests are up to date and also reflect the changes done. Helps us stay in track
- Unit tests in this case differ from manual or automated UI testing. While UI may not exhibit any changes on the surface it is possible code itself might be declaring new variables or making new method calls upon modifications, all of those need to be tested and the new test-scenario or spec-file should be committed together with the feature change.

### Our testing framework
We are using `jasmine` framework for executing unit tests withing `interfaces` and `jest` within services. However, while writing the unit test cases, the writing style and testing paradigm do not differ since `jest` is based on `jasmine` to begin with.

### Key points for writing tests
Keep the following points in mind while writing test cases:
- We should follow a practice to write to tests for all methods except the ones which are private.
- Every method which contains an async call, can be tested by returning a promise that can be spied and stubbed to verify the UI behavior.
- We should aim to write a complementary test for each method written on the file
- Verify class declarations and modifications through methods, boolean variables, string variables, etc.
- Monitor changes within the HTML template(values of attributes, content of buttons) and verify through test cases
- Create "`it ("should....`" scenarios for conditional code as well (e.g. if/else blocks)
- NOTE: It isn't necessary to test all the variables and all method calls, however a highlight of what the method is supposed to accomplish should be reflected within the test cases.
- Use the "`fit`" and "`fdescribe`" to execute only the unit test cases that you are currently working on. Make sure **not** to commit these commands.

- Testing class variables and objects, when they are being defined or constructed
- There are several methods which serve the purpose of defining class wide variables, which we should also test and verify. One of the typical examples of one such method is `ngOnInit`

```ts
it('ngOnInit: should set up variables', () => {
  expect(component.isLoggedIn).toBeDefined(); // check for class variables to be defined
  expect(component.someValye).toBeTruthy();  // check for a variable to be TRUE
  expect(component.someValye).toBeFalsy();  // check for a variable to be FALSE
});
```

The methods written as `toBeTruthy` are called matchers, they help us compare the expected values, their types, whether a method was called, the arguments of the methods and also their existence. There are various methods provided by the testing module. We can find a detailed list of those methods and their usage here: <https://jasmine.github.io/api/3.5/matchers.html>

A short introduction tutorial, to start off writing test cases can be found at: <https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite>


#### Testing method callbacks and changes
- In order to test for methods to have been called, or been called with certain arguments use `spy` and `toHaveBeenCalled`/ `toHaveBeenCalledWith` matchers.

```ts
// Code
public doLogin(event: Event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  // ...rest of the actual method.
}

// Test
it('some_method: should call another fn', () => {
  spyOn(event, "preventDefault"); // Monitor the said method
  component.doLogin(event); // call some_method
  expect(event.preventDefault).toHaveBeenCalled(); // check for the monitored method to have been called
});
```

#### Testing conditional statements
- Make separate `it` blocks for different conditions.

```ts
it("Test when xyz === 'some-value'", () => {})
it("Test when xyz !== 'some-value'", () => {})
```

#### Testing Async methods (i.e. methods which make an API call)
- Make a Spy for the specific async call which returns a Promise object. For example a method containing a call routine `this.programsService.changePassword` can be spied using following

```ts
let spy = spyOn(component.programsService, "changePassword").and.returnValue(Promise.resolve(true));
```

- Based on the changes / executions upon the completion of the async request, we should aim to test the changes and modifications.

```ts
// block to test what happens after the async calls:
spy.calls.mostRecent().returnValue.then(() => {
  // Here goes expectations and changes
});
```

- Make sure the `done()` method is used to account for the async calls and fake async stubs/spies.

```ts
it('XYZ', (done) => {
  // spies and stubs

  spy.calls.mostRecent().returnValue.then(() => {
    // tests
    done(); // to complete the tests
  });
});
```

#### Testing HTML elements
- By using the `defaultEl` and the monitoring the changes within the HTML pages. However, the testing here does not bring a lot of productivity in terms of what we get out of it. So, we can choose to discard this aspect of testing.
- HTML elements are tested by matching the `string` values, which is not very intuitive with `i18n` modules in use

## Releases
See notable changes and the currently release version in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

### Release Checklist
This is how we create and publish a new release of the 121-platform.  
(See [the glossary](#glossary) for definitions of some terms.)

- [ ] Define the date/time of the release. (Notify the dev-team for a code-freeze.)
- [ ] Define what code gets released. ("_Is the current `master`-branch working?_")
- [ ] Define the `version`(-number) for the upcoming release.
- [ ] Update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) with the date + version.
  - [ ] Commit changes to `master`-branch on GitHub.
- [ ] Create a `release`-branch ("`release/<version>`") from current `master`-branch
  - [ ] Push this branch to GitHub
- [ ] Run the [Azure Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/redcrossnl/121%20Platform/_build) for the native Android-apps on that `release`-branch
  - [ ] Download the generated artifacts (`PA-App.zip`)
  - [ ] Rename to match the version (i.e: `PA-App-v0.1.0.zip`)
- [ ] "[Draft a release](https://github.com/global-121/121-platform/releases/new)" on GitHub  
  - [ ] Add the `version` to create a new tag
  - [ ] Select the new `release/<version>`-branch
  - [ ] Set the title of the release to `version`
  - [ ] Add a short description and/or link to relevant other documents (if applicable)
  - [ ] Create/publish the release on GitHub

### Patch/Hotfix Checklist

This follows the same process as a regular release + deployment. With some small changes.
- Code does not need to be frozen. (As there is no active development on the release-branch)

#### Manual approach
- Checkout the `release/<version>`-branch that needs the hotfix.
- Create a new local branch (e.g. `release/<v0.x.1>`) and make the changes
- Push this branch directly to the main/upstream repository, not to a personal fork.
- Create a new release (see above) and publish it.  
  The publish-command will invoke the webhook(s), which trigger an automated deploy for environments on that same *minor* version.
- Add the hotfix-release to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
- After the hotfix-release, apply the same fix to the master-branch in a regular PR (by creating a PR from the hotfix-branch to `master`-branch)

#### GitHub web-interface-only approach
- Browse to the specific file that needs a fix on GitHub, click "edit" and make the changes  
  The URL will look like: `https://github.com/global-121/121-platform/edit/release/v0.x.0/<path-to-file>`
- Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" from the "commit changes"-box
- Use `release/v0.x.1` as the branch-name by clicking "Propose changes"  
  This branch will now be created and is available to use for a new release
- Add the hotfix-release to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and commit to the same `release/v0.x.1` branch.
- Create a new release (see above) and publish it.  
  The publish-command will invoke the webhook(s), which trigger an automated deploy for environments on that same *minor* version.
- After the hotfix-release, apply the fixes to the master-branch by merging the PR created.


## Deployment

### To "test" environment
- Merged PR's to 'master' branch are automatically deployed to the test-server. (via [webhook](tools/webhook.service), see: [/tools#GitHub-webhook](tools/README.md#github-webhook))
  - To skip deployment after a PR is merged, add `[SKIP CD]` to the title of the PR before merging. (For example when only updating documentation)
- Make sure to update the environment-settings as soon as possible, preferably before the merge+deploy.

### To "production" environment

#### On initial deployment (only)
- [ ] Configure environment(s) as described in [/services > Getting started / Installation](services/README.md#getting-started-installation).
  - [ ] Checkout code (of latest release)
  - [ ] Set secrets, configure ENV-variables (via all `.env`-files)
  - [ ] Build the platform (by running the [deploy script](./tools/deploy.sh)):  
        Run: `sudo ./tools/deploy.sh`
- [ ] Setup the web-server as described in [/tools > Hosting > Apache2](tools/README.md#apache2)
- [ ] (Optional) Add data to the database using the available [seed-script](services/121-service/README.md#Seed-the-database)

#### On next deployments
- [ ] Decide on what version to deploy
- [ ] Check for any changes/additions/removals in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] Prepare the environment accordingly (in all `.env`-files)
  - [ ] Build the platform (by running the [deploy script](./tools/deploy.sh)):  
        Run: `sudo ./tools/deploy.sh <target-branch>`, where `<target-branch>` is for example: `release/v0.1.0`
