## Change SMS and/or WhatsApp phone-numbers for PA

1. PA gets in contact with **Pilot-team** if phone is lost
2. **Pilot-team** provides to **121-dev-team**:
   - Name: can be any of the first/second/third/last name attributes
   - Old phone number(s): can be SMS and/or WhatsApp phone number
   - New WhatsApp phone(s)-number (if need to replace)
   - New SMS phone-number (if need to replace)
3. **121-dev-team**:
   1. Find the `connection` of the PA that we want to update, using `Find DID of PA in database based on name and/or phone number` scenario below.
   2. Use the found connection `did` to update the phone-numbers.
      - Use: [`/sovrin/create-connection/phone/overwrite`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/sovrin/post_sovrin_create_connection_phone_overwrite)  
        To store the new SMS phone-number. (Make sure to ONLY include the numbers, no whitespace or `+`)
      - Use: [`/sovrin/create-connection/custom-data/overwrite`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/sovrin/post_sovrin_create_connection_custom_data_overwrite)  
        To store the new WhatsApp phone-number, with: `key` set to `whatsappPhoneNumber`. (Make sure to ONLY include the numbers, no whitespace or `+`)

## Find DID of PA in database based on name and/or phone number

1. [Log-in with Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in) as a "`program-manager`"-role user
2. Find the `connection` of the PA that we want to update.  
   Use the endpoint: [`/sovrin/create-connection/get-did/name-phone`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/sovrin/post_sovrin_create_connection_get_did_name_phone)  
   Where you can optionally fill in `name` and/or old `phoneNumber` to search for.

   This will return all connections that match _at least one_ of the parameters.

   - If 0 connections are returned, try spelling variations.
   - If multiple connections are returned, try to figure out which is the correct one.
     - Maybe there are PA with the same name, but different phone-numbers?
     - Maybe one is an unfinished registration?
     - Check back with the **Pilot-team** if still unclear.
   - If 1 connection is returned, continue

## Translations

### Update translations in seed-data from Transifex

1. From the "Resources" page: <https://www.transifex.com/redcrossnl/121-platform/content/>
2. Select one of the "`Instance: *`", "`FSP: *`" or "`Program: *`" resources.
3. Select the language to get the latest translations for.
4. Click "**Download for use**" from the pop-up.
5. Open the file in an (code-)editor, to:
   - Replace all instances of `"en"` with the selected language's code, i.e: `"saq_KE"` (for Samburu, Kenya)
   - Save the file (temporarily), for example as "`instance-kenya.saq_KE.json`"
6. Merge this file with the existing file in the repository
   - This can be done in-code via JavaScript.  
     See: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/21450110>
   - With a command-line tool.
     - `jq` <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>
     - `json` <http://trentm.com/json/#FEATURE-Merging>
   - By-hand.
     - Add each `"saq_KE"`-property next-to its `"en"`-sibling. (Take note of the last comma!)
     - Make sure the output is valid JSON and properly formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
7. Commit this version of the file.

### Update source-text for translations in Transifex

1. Take the preferred source-file (`instance`, `fsp` or `program`)
2. Remove **_ALL OTHER_** language-texts except "`en`"
3. Use this edited version of the file to upload in Transifex
   1. Go to "Resources" page: <https://www.transifex.com/redcrossnl/121-platform/content/>
   2. Select one of the "`Instance: *`", "`FSP: *`" or "`Program: *`" resources.
   3. Click the "**[ Update source file ]**"-button and use the edited, English only version.
